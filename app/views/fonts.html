            To be, or not to be: that is the question:
            <br>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
            <br>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
            <br>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
            <br>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
            <br>No more; and, by a sleep to say we end
            <br>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
            <br>That flesh is heir to, ’tis a consummation
            <br>Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;
            <br>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;
            <br>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
            <br>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
            <br>Must give us pause. There’s the respect
            <br>That makes calamity of so long life;
            <br>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
            <br>The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
            <br>The pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,
            <br>The insolence of office, and the spurns
            <br>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
            <br>When he himself might his quietus make
            <br>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
            <br>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
            <br>But that the dread of something after death,
            <br>The undiscover’d country from whose bourn
            <br>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
            <br>And makes us rather bear those ills we have
            <br>Than fly to others that we know not of?
            <br>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
            <br>And thus the native hue of resolution
            <br>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
            <br>And enterprises of great pith and moment
            <br>With this regard their currents turn awry,
            <br>And lose the name of action. Soft you now!
            <br>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
            <br>Be all my sins remember’d.
