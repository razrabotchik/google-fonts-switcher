    To be, or not to be: that is the question:
    <br>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    <br>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    <br>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    <br>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
    <br>No more; and, by a sleep to say we end
    <br>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
    <br>That flesh is heir to, ’tis a consummation
    <br>Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;
    <br>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;
    <br>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    <br>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    <br>Must give us pause. There’s the respect
    <br>That makes calamity of so long life;
    <br>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    <br>The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
    <br>The pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,
    <br>The insolence of office, and the spurns
    <br>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
    <br>When he himself might his quietus make
    <br>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
    <br>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    <br>But that the dread of something after death,
    <br>The undiscover’d country from whose bourn
    <br>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
    <br>And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    <br>Than fly to others that we know not of?
    <br>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
    <br>And thus the native hue of resolution
    <br>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
    <br>And enterprises of great pith and moment
    <br>With this regard their currents turn awry,
    <br>And lose the name of action. Soft you now!
    <br>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
    <br>Be all my sins remember’d.
